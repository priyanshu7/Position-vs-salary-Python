# Position-vs-salary-Python
This repository contains different non-linear regression techniques used to solve a Non-Linear problem of the given dataset.
Given a situation that salary of an employee has to be predicted by the level he's been working at, the dataset shows non linear trend, therefore in the codes I've compared the regression results of different non-linear techniques within themselves as well as to the non linear regression model.
The different Non Linear techniques shown here are:
1. Polynomial Regression
2. Support Vector Regression
3. Decision Tree Regression
4. Random Forest Regression
